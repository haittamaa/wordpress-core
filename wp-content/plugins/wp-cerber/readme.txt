= Limit login attempts done right =

By default, WordPress allows unlimited login attempts through the login form, XML-RPC or by sending special cookies. This allows passwords to be cracked with relative ease via brute force attack.

WP Cerber blocks intruders by IP or subnet from making further attempts after a specified limit on retries is reached, making brute force attacks or distributed brute force attacks from botnets impossible.

You will be able to create a **Black  Access List** or **White Access List** to block or allow logins from particular IP address, IP address range or subnet any class (A,B,C).

Moreover, you can create your Custom login page and forget about automatic attacks to the default wp-login.php, which takes your attention and consumes a lot of server resources. If an attacker tries to access wp-login.php they will be blocked and get a 404 Error response.

= Log, filter out and export activities =

WP Cerber tracks time, IP addresses and usernames for successful and failed login attempts, logins, logouts, password changes, blocked IP and actions taken by itself. Export them to a CSV file.

= Limit login attempts reinvented =

You can **hide WordPress dashboard** (/wp-admin/) when a user isn't logged in. If a user isn't logged in and they attempt to access the dashboard by requesting /wp-admin/, WP Cerber will return a 404 Error.

Massive botnet brute force attack? That's no longer a problem. **Citadel mode** will automatically be activated for awhile and prevent your site from making further attempts to log in with any username.

* WooCommerce login form
* WooCommerce register form
* WooCommerce lost password form

= Antispam protection: invisible reCAPTCHA for WordPress =

* WordPress login form
* WordPress register form
* WordPress lost password form

== Installation ==

Installing WP Cerber security plugin is the same as other WordPress plugins.

1. Install the plugin through Plugins > Add New > Upload or unzip plugin package into wp-content/plugins/.
2. Activate the WP Cerber through the Plugins > Installed Plugins menu in the WordPress admin dashboard.
3. The plugin is now active and has started protecting you site with default settings.
4. Make sure, that you received a notification letter on the your site admin email.

**Important notes**

1. Before enabling invisible reCAPTCHA, you must get separate keys for invisible version. [How to enable reCAPTCHA](http://wpcerber.com/how-to-setup-recaptcha/).
2. If you want to test out plugin's features, do this from another computer and remove that computer's network from the White Access List. Cerber is smart enough to recognize "the boss".
3. If you've set up the Custom login URL and you use some caching plugin like **W3 Total Cache** or **WP Super Cache**, you have to add a new Custom login URL to the list of pages not to cache.
4. [Read this if your website is under CloudFlare](http://wpcerber.com/cloudflare-and-wordpress-cerber/)

The following steps are optional but they allow you to reinforce protection of your WordPress.

1. Fine tune **Limit login attempts** settings making them more restrictive according your needs
2. Configure your **Custom login URL** and remember it (the plugin will send you an email with it).
3. Once you have configured Custom login URL, check 'Immediately block IP after any request to wp-login.php' and 'Block direct access to wp-login.php and return HTTP 404 Not Found Error'.
4. Don't use wp-admin to log in to your WordPress dashboard anymore.
5. If your website has a few experienced users, check 'Immediately block IP when attempting to login with a non-existent username'.
6. Specify the list of prohibited usernames (logins) that legit users will never use. They will not be allowed to log in and register in any circumstances.
7. Configure mobile and browser notifications via Pushbullet.
8. Obtain keys and enable invisible reCAPTCHA for password reset and registration forms (WooCommerce supported too).

= Is WP Cerber compatible with bbPress? =

Yes. [Compatibility notes](http://wpcerber.com/compatibility/).

= Is this plugin compatible with WooCommerce? =

Completely.

= Is reCAPTCHA for WooCommerce free feature? =

Yes. [How to set up reCAPTCHA for WooCommerce](http://wpcerber.com/how-to-setup-recaptcha/).

= Can I hide wp-admin? =

Yes, easily. [How to hide wp-admin and wp-login.php from possible attacks](http://wpcerber.com/how-to-hide-wp-admin-and-wp-login-php-from-possible-attacks/)

= Can I rename wp-admin folder? =

Nope. It's not possible and not recommended for compatibility reasons.

= Can WP Cerber work together with the Limit Login Attempts plugin? =

Nope. WP Cerber is a drop in replacement for that outdated plugin.

= Can WP Cerber protect my site from DDoS attacks? =

Nope. WP Cerber protects your site from Brute force attacks or distributed Brute force attacks. By default WordPress allows unlimited login attempts either through the login form or by sending special cookies. This allows passwords to be cracked with relative ease via a brute force attack. To prevent from such a bad situation use WP Cerber.

= Is there any WordPress plugin to protect my site from DDoS attacks? =

Nope. This hard task cannot be done by using a plugin. That may be done by using special hardware from your hosting provider.

= What is the goal of Citadel mode? =

Citadel mode is intended to block massive, distributed botnet attacks and also slow attacks. The last type of attack has a large range of intruder IPs with a small number of attempts to login per each.

= How to turn off Citadel mode completely? =

Set Threshold fields to 0 or leave them empty.

= What is the goal of using Fail2Ban? =

With Fail2Ban you can protect site on the OS level with iptables. See details here: [http://wpcerber.com/how-to-protect-wordpress-with-fail2ban/](http://wpcerber.com/how-to-protect-wordpress-with-fail2ban/)

= Do I need using Fail2Ban to get the plugin working? =

No, you don't. It is optional.

= Can I use this plugin on the WP Engine hosting? =

Yes! WP Cerber is not on the list of disallowed plugins. There are no limitation on the hosting providers. You can use it even on the shared hosting. Plugin consumes minimum resources and does not impact server performance or response time.

= It seems that old activity records are not removing from the activity log =

That means that scheduled tasks are not executed on your site. In other words, WordPress cron is not working the right way.
Try to add the following line to your wp-config.php file:

define( 'ALTERNATE_WP_CRON', true );

= I can't login / I'm locked out of my site / How to get access (log in) to the dashboard? =

There is a special version of the plugin called **WP Cerber Reset**. This version performs only one task. It will reset all WP Cerber settings to initial values (excluding Access Lists) and then will deactivate itself.

To get access to your dashboard you need to copy the WP Cerber Reset folder to the plugins folder. Follow these simple steps.

1. Download the wp-cerber-reset.zip archive to your computer using this link: [http://wpcerber.com/downloads/wp-cerber-reset.zip](http://wpcerber.com/downloads/wp-cerber-reset.zip)
2. Unpack wp-cerber folder from the archive.
3. Upload the wp-cerber folder to the **plugins** folder of your site using any FTP client or a file manager from your hosting control panel. If you see a question about overwriting files, click Yes.
4. Log in to your site as usually. Now WP Cerber is disabled completely.
5. Reinstall the WP Cerber plugin again. You need to do that, because **WP Cerber Reset** cannot work as a normal plugin.

1. If you want to test out plugin's features, do this from another computer and remove that computer's network from the White Access List. Cerber is smart enough to recognize "the boss".
2. If you've set up the Custom login URL and you use some caching plugin like **W3 Total Cache** or **WP Super Cache**, you have to add a new Custom login URL to the list of pages not to cache.
